# Verbs Prop #1: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP


## IDEA: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP

We spoke with @4156#9052 and love his ideas of _Noun'o'clock_ as an Internet cultural moment. We want to build momentum around this idea. One of the first steps is to build infrastructure that will enable anyone, even without coding abilities, to work with Noun auction metadata - specifically because of the shifting time of Noun'o'clock.

That's why the first project we would like to propose for your consideration is a Noun o'clock app on Zapier & Integromat.

This will enable anyone to work with basic Noun auction metadata, all with the most popular no-code automation tools.


## WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

Zapier and Integromat apps have a trigger configuration and a data payload you'll receive when triggered.


### Trigger configuration



* You'll choose a time to be triggered relative to the next Noun o'clock
* The trigger will support auction extensions


### Trigger payload



* The current highest bid / the winner when it's post-o'clock: address + bid amount
* Bid history: address + bid amount
* Minimum bid
* The Noun
    * Art
    * Number
* Current treasury balance


### Concrete implementations as part of this proposal



* **Noun'o'clock reminder in the #general Discord**
    * With the help of a Nounder discord admin, we will add an automatic update for estimated Noun'o'clock as soon as a new auction is created
    * We will also add a reminder 1 hour and 5 minutes before Noun'o'clock (exact timing to be optimized as per community feedback)
* **Noun'o'clock reminders tweets on the @nounsdao account**
    * With the help of a Nounder twitter admin, we will add an automatic update for estimated Noun'o'clock as soon as a new auction is created
    * We will also add a reminder 1 hour and 5 minutes before Noun'o'clock (exact timing to be optimized as per community feedback)
* **Set up Nouns google calendar**
    * To enable people to plan for Noun'o'clock, we will set up a public Google calendar that anyone can subscribe to
    * We will automatically create an event for Noun'o'clock in the calendar using the Zapier (or Integromat) implementation


## EXAMPLE USE CASES


### Noun'o'clock Twitter Bot



* Help NFT twitter know when the next Noun'o'clock is
* Anyone will be able to easily create a twitter bot using the Noun'o'clock trigger that will execute as soon as the last auction is over


### Noun'o'clock reminder



* Always know when Noun'o'clock is with notification on Slack/Discord/SMS when Noun'o'clock is X minutes away
* Anyone will be able to create an alert system by building a simple automation
* Create sophisticated automations:
    * If the auction bid is lower than X and time is Y minutes away


### Track stats DIY



* People who want to track noun market data can create an automation to insert data to a Google sheet


## TECHNICAL SCOPE



* Web server that tracks Noun'o'clock, and invokes the automations at the desired time
* Zapier & Integromat apps
    * Using the Nouns favicon art as the apps' icon
* All code will be open sourced on Github
* SLA: 99% uptime


## REMUNERATION



* 11 ETH for the development scope listed above
* 1.5 ETH for estimated server costs for a year
* 2.5 ETH for estimated maintenance work for a year

15 ETH total.

Subsequent years of maintenance and future improvements/features to come in separate proposals.
